wxvx Overview
----------------------------------------------------

:term:`EAGLE` uses :term:`wxvx` to verify model forecasts against either gridded
analyses or point observations.

Within the EAGLE workflow, ``wxvx`` is responsible for running the underlying
verification tasks and producing the statistics and plots used to evaluate
forecast performance. In practice, this means you can compare both ``global``
and :term:`LAM` forecasts against:

* gridded analyses with MET's
  `grid_stat <https://metplus.readthedocs.io/projects/met/en/latest/Users_Guide/grid-stat.html>`_
* point observations with MET's
  `point_stat <https://metplus.readthedocs.io/projects/met/en/latest/Users_Guide/point-stat.html>`_

Before running verification, complete the preprocessing steps described in the
:ref:`Quickstart Guide <QuickstartVerification>` so that forecast output has
already been prepared for ``wxvx``.

See the `wxvx repository <https://github.com/maddenp-cu/wxvx>`_ for further
information about the project itself.

wxvx Quick Tips
----------------------------------------------------

* Run the provided :term:`PreWXVX` steps before starting verification.
* Use the ``vx-grid-*`` targets to verify against gridded analyses.
* Use the ``vx-obs-*`` targets to verify against PrepBUFR observations.
* The ``global`` and ``lam`` targets are independent, so they can be run in
  parallel.
* Check the ``run/<expname>/vx/*.log`` files if a verification job fails.


Running Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EAGLE provides four standard verification targets:

.. code-block:: bash

   make vx-grid-global config=eagle.yaml
   make vx-grid-lam config=eagle.yaml
   make vx-obs-global config=eagle.yaml
   make vx-obs-lam config=eagle.yaml

These commands submit batch jobs for:

* ``grid-global``: global forecasts verified against gridded analyses
* ``grid-lam``: limited-area forecasts verified against gridded analyses
* ``obs-global``: global forecasts verified against point observations
* ``obs-lam``: limited-area forecasts verified against point observations

Because these are separate jobs, they can be launched in quick succession to
run in parallel.


Verification Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a verification job completes successfully, ``wxvx`` writes output beneath
the corresponding verification run directory:

.. code-block:: text

   run/<expname>vx/grid2{grid,obs}/{global,lam}/run/

The most useful outputs are:

* ``stats/`` for MET ``.stat`` files
* ``plots/`` for generated ``.png`` plots
* ``run/<expname>vx/*.log`` for verification logs


Additional Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After verification is complete, you can generate additional postprocessed
:term:`visualization` outputs with:

.. code-block:: bash

   make vis-grid-global config=eagle.yaml
   make vis-grid-lam config=eagle.yaml
   make vis-obs-global config=eagle.yaml
   make vis-obs-lam config=eagle.yaml

These targets run ``eagle-tools postwxvx`` to create netCDF summary files and
additional plots under:

.. code-block:: text

   run/<expname>/visualization/grid2{grid,obs}/{global,lam}/
