=================

:term:`EAGLE` currently includes a prototype nested-EAGLE model trained with
global :term:`GFS` data together with :term:`HRRR` data over the Contiguous
United States (CONUS).

This model builds on previous work from Met Norway (Nipen et al., 2024,
arXiv:2409.02891) by combining lower-resolution global data with
higher-resolution data over an area of interest.

nested-EAGLE configurations were provided by Tim Smith at NOAA Physical
Sciences Laboratory.


Training Data
------------------

The nested-EAGLE training dataset combines regridded global and regional
forecast data.

At a glance:

* :term:`GFS` is conservatively regridded to 1 degree.
* :term:`HRRR` is conservatively regridded to 15 km.
* The training period spans ``2015-02-01T06`` through ``2023-01-31T18``.
* The validation period spans ``2023-02-01T06`` through ``2024-01-31T18``.
* The testing period spans ``2024-02-01T06`` through ``2025-01-31T18``.

``1000``.


Model Architecture
------------------

The nested-EAGLE model uses the following architecture:

* Encoder: Graph Transformer
* Processor: Shifted Window Transformer with 512 channels
* Decoder: Graph Transformer

The graph configuration connects targets to nodes through nearest neighbors in
the encoder and decoder, with ``encoder_knn=12`` and ``decoder_knn=3``.

The latent mesh is four times coarser than the native data resolution.
